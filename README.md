# Notality

This is a React + Redux app for organizing notes. I am writing it partly to try out Redux, partly to create a notetaking app that works in a particular way in which I want it to work. (Which happens to be different from how Evernote works.)

## Installing and Running

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The access the app at http://localhost:5000/
